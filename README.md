# gcs
## Git Commit Suicide! A tool for dealing with git quickly.

Git is very easy to work with. However, programmers are lazy and want to be as efficient as possible. One command to do multiple tasks is nice. That's what gcs does. Basically it uses git for you so you can spend less time on git and more time on your project.

Note: gcs does not do everything git does. It will not replace git. Just help you out with it.

## Installation:
### Linux/OSX
For now, all the 'installation' is is putting an alias in your bashrc/profile/whatever that sets gcs equal to "python3 ~/gcs/gcs.py"
Of course for this to work you must put the folder in your home folder. I will add a command-based install later.
For reference, its:
```
alias gcs="python3 ~/gcs/gcs.py"
```
That goes in whatever file you're loading at login.

### Windows
Why would you want to use windows for git projects? Well, just run the python script (but it won't work, i'm warning you), get fed up and install linux. I mean seriously, unless you're gaming there's no reason to have a pc.

## Modification:
I really don't care how much you modify this.
